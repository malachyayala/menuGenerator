Okay, here is a 7-day meal plan based on your inventory, preferences, and cooking for one person, while also considering weight loss, as requested. It prioritizes items nearing expiration (within reasonable bounds).

**Important Notes:**

*   **Expiration Dates:** I will prioritize using items with expiration dates closest to the present date.
*   **Quantities:** I will assume reasonable serving sizes for one person, adjusting as needed based on the provided quantities.
*   **Shopping List:** I will compile a shopping list at the end, noting which recipe needs each item.
*   **Missing Ingredients:** Many recipes will need common ingredients that are *not* in the CSV (e.g., onions, garlic, common vegetables). I will flag these and include a substitution if possible, or add them to the shopping list if not.
*   **"Around 48" gyoza is ambiguous:** I will assume this means you have at least 40 gyoza and will adjust the recipe accordingly.
